2. Select `Woocommerce` from left and go to `Product Catalogue`
3. Now here check for `Default Product Sorting`.
4. Make sure it is set to `Default sorting (custom ordering + name)`

If you have huge list of product and the plugin is not saving the sort order changes then it may be issue with PHP configuration done on your server for `memory_limit` and `max_execution_time`.

Ask your web hosting provider to increase `memory_limit` and `max_execution_time` and try updating sort order after that.
